# Better Button Sounds
This submod modifies the DDLC (and thus, MAS) sfx for buttons such that they're more pleasant to listen to

## Installation:
- Download the source-code zip from [the releases page](https://github.com/multimokia/MAS-Submod-Better-Button-Sfx/releases/latest)
- Extract the zip to your `game` folder (thus merging the two `game` folders together)
- Launch MAS
